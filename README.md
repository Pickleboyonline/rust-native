# rust-native ⚡️

A React Native like framework that uses Rust instead of Javascript

### Why?

Because of Rust's hype and blazingly fast speed. Also, I have Typescript/Javascript fatigue. Oh yeah, and Rust apparantly has the best-in-class memory safety and developer experience.

### General Notes

- SolidJs like reactivity and structure. The choice here is mainly because I could not find a good VDOM library in Rust.
- In general should borrow a lot from the new react native architecture, outlined (here)[https://reactnative.dev/architecture/overview].
  We should be able to use Yoga, the flexbox engine, since its based in C/C++. Frabric can be built in Rust but instead of a VDOM
  we use obersivable reactivity to update Native UIs.
- Should be able to be used on any platform similar to React Native's architecture. The native C bindings for iOS and Android should be
  refactored into standard modules that can be called.

### Main Simplified Goal

- Build the classic React Native counter example using this framework.

### Milestones

- [ ] Build an app that can print "hello world!" in the console.
- [ ] Mount a view from Rust
- [ ] Display a hello world app but with a centered text on display
- [ ] Integrate reactivity into the app with hooks and the like
- [ ] Create/extend macros that manage views and bind methods similar to react.
- [ ] Add styling.
- [ ] hot reloading (hard)

We use (docusaurus)[https://docusaurus.io/] for documentation. Please update the markdowns accordingly

### TODOs:

- Implement Github Actions to auto compile docs on main branch change.
- Learn rust
